# Technical-Trading-Bot
Trading Bot built using the Alpaca API in Python. Indicators used for Signal Generation: EMA, StochRSI, and Stochastic Oscillator

## AUTH

1. configFile.txt: To enable/disable the indicators for which the bot will check and generate buy/sell signals. Other parameters such as:
- Trade Params: % Capital to be used / trade, Stop Loss, Trailing Stop, Limit Price, etc can be changed.
- Data Params: Timeframe, Start Date, End Date
- Indicator Params: Indicator parameters can also be changed in the ConfigFile.txt. 
    1. StochRSI: Lower Band, Upper Band, K, D, RSI Length, etc)
    2. Stoch: Lower Band, Upper Band, K Smoothing, D Smoothing
    3. EMA: Period, Smoothing

2. Tickers.txt: Add ticker symbols (seperated by space) to check the critera for
3. authAlpaca.txt: Add Alpaca API Key and Secret Key for the bot to start trading. Change *"BASE-URL"* to *"api.alpaca.markets"* to trade in real-time markets.

## Root Dir

1. config_params.py: Initializes all the params set by the user in ConfigFile.txt
2. indicator.py: Calculates values and generates signals for all the indicators enabled 
3. main.py: Signal generation, decision-making, trade execution, trade monitoring, email alerts

After the bot starts checking for the buy/sell criteria and places the first trade, there will be 3 new files created in the *ORDERS* folder.
1. Orders.csv: CSV file with all the trades (buy and sell both) placed by the bot
2. Open Orders.csv: CSV file with all the open positions held by the bot. The bot will check for returns using this file and sell once the sell criteria (Stop Loss/Limit Price/Trailing Stop) has been met. The bot will remove the position from _Open Orders.csv_ once it's closed.
3. Time and Coins.csv: Using this file, the bot will ensure that no 2 (or more) trades are placed for the same ticker in the _sleep_time_between_trades_ time period. 
Example: If _sleep_time_between_trades_ is 100 seconds and the bot places a buy trade for ETHUSD, the bot won't check the criteria for ETHUSD for another 100 seconds.
